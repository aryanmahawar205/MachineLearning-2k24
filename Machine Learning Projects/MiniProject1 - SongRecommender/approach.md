## This SongRecommender ML Model is trained as per the following steps

-> Data was imported via csv file. This data had inconsistency which was predicted by the model with a certain level of accuracy. <br>
-> The Data could have been also cleaned. Essentially cleaning of Data was not done in this model.
-> Splitting the Data into Training and Testing sets with 8 : 2 ratio.
-> Creating a model. Here we have used Decision Tree Algorithm.
-> Training the model with the Training set.
-> Making Predictions with certain level of accuracy.
-> Evaluating and improving accuracy by fine tuning procedures, Not done for this particular model.
